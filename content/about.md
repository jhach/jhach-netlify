Hola!

My name is James Hach and I have been a Product Manager since 2015. To me, it's one of the most fulfilling role in tech. When I'm not working, I like to develop websites (like this one) in React+Gatsby, learn the Ukulele, hip hop dance, run, and follow the WWE and anything Seattle sports related.
